# CheatSheetTable
Codecademy Cheat Sheet Project (Table version)


## Introduction

This project is one of the exercises provided for Codecademy students for HTML and CSS practice. 

The commission was to generate a personal cheat sheet containing information on any subject from our HTML and CSS lessons. I already did one on text version and realised the intent was to use a table. I created  a new project in order to practice my skills with tables. The result is the code I have uploaded to this repository.

## Technologies

I used HTML and CSS in VSCODE, used GIT as version control.
